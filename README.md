# ObesityFactors
*This was an open-ended final project for my Statistical Methods in R class in the Spring 2021 semester. 

Using data from The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)â€™s 2017-2018, we were interested in knowing how an individual's social status 
play a role in his/her physical health. We decided to examine various attributes of American adults including marital status, income, number of children, and 
education background and tried to find a correlation among these factors and given individual's body mass index (BMI). The result: generally higher income correlates
to lower obesity levels. Education levels and marital status do not show correlation with weight overall, but they do depending on each income group.
